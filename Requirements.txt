          * Users should see a link for the Basic plan on the home page.

          * The Basic plan (link) should point to the regular Devise sign up form. 
[In Progress]
          * The Pro plan link should point to a custom sign up form (by Devise).
          Stripe Integration
          * Users should have a stripe customer token in the users table.
          * Javascript should prevent Pro form from submitting, when user fills it out,
          and should send card info to Stripe. Stripe will return with a card token.
          * Javascript should send user fields and card token to our rails app. Rails app
          should validate the user fields. Rails app will note whether plan 1 or plan 2.
          * Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, plan id) and card token
          to Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription and send back customer
          token. Rails should save customer token and user information to our database.
